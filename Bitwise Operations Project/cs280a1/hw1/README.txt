Operations.java contains the main method, run with three arguments:
- One decimal number e.g. "10"
- One binary number preceded by "0b" e.g. "0b1010"
- One hexadecimal number preceded by "0x" e.g. "0xAF"

This is a project I did for my Computer Systems Foundations course(CS280a1).
It's meant to show understanding of conversions between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal, as well as different bitwise operations between them.
