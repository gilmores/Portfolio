Operations.java contains the main method, run with three arguments:
- One decimal number e.g. "10"
- One binary number preceded by "0b" e.g. "0b1010"
- One hexadecimal number preceded by "0x" e.g. "0xAF"

If the autograder flags an error, it's likely because the printed statements 
are out of order. Thanks!
